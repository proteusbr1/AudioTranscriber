      "There are people who don't know who the mayor is, even today, in this condominium. I think this is regrettable. I also think it's regrettable that a condominium has 300 residences, and there are 40 people participating. It's regrettable, because tomorrow there won't be anyone who will ask why it was decided like this. So that's it, and let's touch the boat, please, because it's 11 o'clock, people. Does anyone else want to speak? Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry, Larissa had to leave, and only Angela, another online resident supporter. There are more people in the line, can I speak? Please. I think it's me. It's me, Q4. Now, H11. H11, what are you saying? I already said it, H11 already said it, you can take it off. So now, E21 too. E21, I said it. E16. Q04. It's me. When I did the registration, I had a doubt, but I just wanted to ratify this understanding. From what I understood from Cesar's presentation, and after reading Carol's, we have two positions, or two lines of action, in relation to energy. Cesar understands that the best way, perhaps, is the part of the negotiation, together with Neoenergia, trying to save money, or wanting to negotiate, or extend the term. And from what I saw from the study, from the reading, which I had not understood in this way, from the presentation in relation to the fiscal council, which intends to pay R$ 9,000 to update the plan for 2021, to present this plan, and try to make a negotiation on paper, in relation to this future proclamation or discussion of the rights of A or B. Is that exactly it? No, they are different situations. The issue of charging for public electricity, which was addressed by Cesar, is not addressed in the Council's report. This proposal of the project is for us to modernize our network of electricity distribution, to minimize or solve the issues of energy failure, of instability, which happens especially from Group A to Group J. I had understood that Cesar, after you did the reading, said that there was a small difference in relation to the appearance, and that's why I was induced to this interpretation. But I think it's interesting to make it clear, if it's not just me who didn't understand, and maybe others, exactly this distinction. One thing, then, is that Cesar wants to see the issue of this passive in relation to the charging of public energy, of the discussion of the charging of energy for public posts. This is an issue. From what I understood, he has already satisfied, maybe there is no other solution in relation to this. The other, in relation to the Council, is what to do with this problem, as you said, of the Groups A or K in relation to the instability of energy. So, we are here kind of discussing, back and forth, but I think that the two actions can continue. Cesar, make your negotiation and try to present, as soon as he has an answer, through a statement, so that he can be aware of the success he can have in this negotiation of his, and in the same way, in relation to the Council, I think that these R$ 9,000 have already been approved, I think it was the decision of the previous Council, was it? This was an internal decision of the Council with the administration, and then the administration went back, because, according to the verbalization of TerraCap, this would not be feasible. And then, Cesar's manifestation of disagreement is that he believes that we should not initiate this negotiation formally. Do you understand? I understand. In his opinion, we should not update the project, we should not submit the energy ring, we should not submit TerraCap. And what would be this other solution? And what would be this other solution, and not doing, theoretically, what Figurino says? And not doing anything. Wait for the end of the revalidation. Ah, ok. Not doing anything is for a reason of waiting for the end of the regularization to discuss this issue at the time of the regularization, is that it? It is after the regularization. Cesar understands that this has to be postponed until the end of the regularization. And then I am presenting the legal, juridical possibility of being executed in advance. Yes. Our counterpoint there, Fábio, Carol, she said, she showed, she showed that there are juridical arguments that can be used for execution. I claim that as we are in a broader process in which we are the owner, but in fact when the owner is the land owner, I think that doing anything juridical, or eventually using juridical arguments, is like poking a jaguar with a cockroach. That's it. But I think that things are complementary. You can do it, you can approve that we are going to make the plan, but I would ask at least three months to try to finish the broader negotiation of payment. I couldn't come to them and say, look, you don't do it, we will do it and juridically we will sanction you. At the same time I try to negotiate, look, we don't want to pay this, we don't want to pay that. You know? Now I understand the point of contact between the two things. That this action or initiative of the Council may interfere in your negotiation. Exactly, that's my point of view. I'm not against it, I think we have to do it, we have to make improvements. If we wait, it will never come out. But since we are at a point of negotiation, we have a perspective of 400,000, I want to negotiate to decrease it. I can't demand too much, I almost have to ask for a favor. I'm asking for a discount. I don't know if I'm wrong, if administratively this is not the best way, but that's the way I see it. Regardless of whether you put something in the vote, Cesar, I just put a suggestion in this negotiation, showing a certain goodwill to this issue of quitting this passive, so that Neoenergia could change the posts that are more damaged. This will not happen, in two years that Cesar is asking, they changed one post. They changed three posts, two necessary and one wrong. They left the post that was necessary to change and the one that was wrong was much better. It's difficult. And the post that they changed, they left the condominium that had to collect and pay the cost of the collection. It's a dismissal of Neoenergia without size. I agree and I understand the two positions. We just have to get to a good term so that one action doesn't harm the other. I think that's what we have to coordinate. Mr. President, as we are on a general subject... Mr. President, as we are on a general subject, I would like to ask you to be a little more clear, as this subject, energy, will not be voted, but it's a presentation for us to get to know what the thoughts are. If we keep debating something that will not be voted today, I understand that this is for clarification, and we will spend the whole night because the subject of energy is a very complex subject for us to deal with general subjects. This is my point, and I ask the Presidency to be clear on the subject so that we don't leave here today. Thank you, Jorge. Is there anyone else registered? Larissa? Yes, we have M16 and then F04. And that's it? Yes, at least those are the last two registered. Perfect. M16? Hi, Edson. Edson? Good evening again. I think it was very well done, very well pointed. I was in doubt about what the agenda was, the divergence, the subject of electric energy, but what was being proposed, I still have doubts, but I don't think it fits, because if there is no vote, we will follow the boat and follow the boat, right? Angela? F04. I'm F4 too. I'm following this, we've been following it for a while, this project that is being reactivated. We actively participated in it in the past, but these two things are different. One is infrastructure and the other is the passive part. That's my point of view. The infrastructure part is independent, because everything that we apply as infrastructure can come in our favor at the time of the negotiation of the prices of the lots. Excellent. I see that they are different things, because then we will have to raise the streets, the pavement, the enclosures, to try to somehow reduce the prices of the lots, because all the infrastructure was done by us. As César said at the beginning, Terra Cape is seeing the bare land, it is not seeing the house, it is not seeing here, it is not seeing there. Except for this new lot that has to be extinct, the other 321 are bare lands. So I see it as two different things. One is to negotiate the passive, the other is to try to improve the infrastructure, and this has been happening for a long time. Have we improved a lot? Of course we have, but there are still certain problems in certain places. The other thing... Can you explain what you are talking about? At the beginning, I wrote and it saddens me that we have changed because of the pandemic. There were a lot of excuses. We are at home, in the comfort of our home, in an online NGO, and we have no more than 13% of participants. And tomorrow we will be stoned by some decisions we made, but unfortunately we live in a community like this. Is that ok? Just to clarify what you said, my perception of this verbalization made by the president of TerraCap, that we should not interfere in the electrical infrastructure, reflects the interest of TerraCap in that we do not invest and do not decrease the lot price. So it means, let's postpone this to do it only after inflation, I charge a high price and you do it for free. Because if we invest now, this value will come back in lots and we will have a quality electrical energy. So why does TerraCap count? Because it will count in its financial interests. This is my personal opinion. Carol, a clarification. Better or worse energy network does not lower the price of lots. Because these have already been donated to concessionaires. So it has a fixed price of lowering. Does it have energy? Yes. Is it good or bad? It does not matter. It has. And it was donated. No, no, better energy will lower the price more. No. Just clarifying. Otherwise we are in the illusion and then spend money and then nothing improves But they did not tell me why to invest. Sorry, but it is not. In my opinion, this is debatable, César. If you invest in an environment and you have the tax rate of the investment, it will be debatable even judicially. Carol, just quickly, I will bring the experience that I had in the condominium where I currently live. I was a union member here for 3 or 4 years and we have already gone through the regularization process, all these projects that the private sector is going through, and this was a question that I was going to consider. The question of improvements are made at the value of the land, of all the improvements, the fence, the pavement, the half-wire. And I say more, they made a mistake here, I will not say a mistake, but GDF itself made the new half-wire of the condominium and in the end it discounted the welfare, which it was itself that did. So, everything that is welfare within the condominium is deducted in the final value of the negotiation. They count the market value, there is a view that comes from the condominium and looks at everything that is there, and based on that they discount this value that was theoretically invested by the condominium. As César said, the network is donated, but a calculation is made of what was spent at the time, because the condominium had a cost to implement this network and donate it to Neoenergia, an old series. And just one more question, this question of the public lighting charge. We went through this here recently too, the lighting charge. Neoenergia came in here several times to make the charge. The problem here was that the syndicate recognized the debt. They almost cooperated to sign the document and they signed it, and now Neoenergia is charging. In fact, we have the debt linked to the CNPJ of the condominium. Just this question of the public lighting charge. I don't want to be pessimistic, César, I admire your effort in trying to win, but here we tried a lot with Neoenergia, SEB, to negotiate this. Since I'm giving you the network, since I make improvements, since I do maintenance, so I want the return. And it never existed. And they don't do it, they never did it. So they just want to charge these values, for a deficit, I don't know what the company has, but from my own experience from the period I was in management, it's very difficult. The only thing we managed here in the condominium was the implementation of the water network of Caesby, which we were supplied by the Artesian well. And the urban project said that to regularize, to sell to Terra Cape, you have to have basic sanitation. So we took that and that's it. But the urban projects and all the other projects for regularization, they don't mention this issue of electric network, so it doesn't give a response for you to demand that Terra Cape do a charity to sell you that property. And the consideration that these values are discounted, they really are. Carolina, let me remind you that it's already 11.23 pm and the deadline is 11.30 pm. It's five hours of assembly in the system, so it's going to end. Carolina, let me say something quick. You and Cesar are saying the same thing. Cesar is right. The network is there, they're going to charge for it. If we improve it, they're not going to discount it anymore. The network is there, if it's good or not, they're going to quantify it and charge. What happens, what he's asking for, it's three, four months, it's not going to interfere with anything we're proposing now. It's not going to change anything. We can redo the project and wait a little bit. Because when we... I'm negotiating with Bela Vista, which is the same thing that's happening here. So the network that's there is the one that's there. If it's bad or good, there's no problem. It's going to be quantified the same way. What we spend now is not going to be discounted. It's going to be discounted because we've given the network. I agree with him. I'm the guy who fought the most to improve the electrical network. I think we can wait a little longer but we can update the project. Thank you. Thank you, Cid. I think Jorge wanted to talk about another topic and I had cut him off back there. Jorge, would you like to speak? Yes. I don't think it's going to happen yet because we keep talking about saving with motorcycles, saving with batteries, saving with tree roots. But I would like to bring to you, César, you who are the administrator of the condominium and to everyone who is listening, our condominium has an accountant, our condominium has a tax counselor, our condominium has an accounting company. At least I get a ticket every month. I can't understand, honestly, maybe my head is limited, I can't understand why there are so many employees in that administration. And more, for what? Administrative manager, financial manager, for what? I would really like to understand this. I can't, honestly, I think that there is a cost, I don't know what it will take, but it is a very high cost for low efficiency. I am not managing the condominium, César is, he is the one managing the condominium, but certainly, César, there must be another way because there is no condition. There are reports that people spend the day on Facebook and these other things. I don't know if it's true that I don't go there and you know that I don't go into that administration. But people tell me that. And I honestly don't see a reason, today I don't see a reason to have so much expense with an employee inside that administration. This, I don't know if it's everyone's feeling, but it's my feeling. As I am a condominium, I have the right to express. I would like, César, for you to make an analysis of this, together with the fiscal council, which also manages the condominium accounts, to make a general analysis, because I understand that there is no condition, there is no need, there is no need for three employees there. This is my opinion. Or, if there is a need, why so many managers? If there are so many managers, for what council, for what accountant? Forgive me my agony, because time is running out, but that's all I wanted to say. Okay? Registered, Jorge. Anyone else? We can close in the last few minutes. Quickly, I'll ask César later. How is the agreement for the security part? We decided in the previous assembly that the security agreement would be made. I know it took a long time, just to, if it's in 30 seconds, say if it's working, if it's supplementing, if it's still there. Let me share it quickly. I'll speak in 30 seconds, but I have to show the document. Just remembering that if it falls, the assembly is closed, right? Okay, thank you, Cleber. Because there is one minute left for the five hours of assembly. We had a long time to reach an agreement on the terms of how they would pay. As it is a value of R$100, the accountant, as Cleber told me, no one is going to take it, to account for it. One of the reasons for us to go through BRT is to be able to use his ticket system for these charges. I was going to show the document that I received yesterday, finally signed, of how we should proceed. It's working. It took a long time, it took 30 years, 6 or 7 months more. That's enough. Thank you very much, César. Just so we can close the circuit between what was said in the previous assembly to know if things are working. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you very much. It was an excellent assembly. The 25 surviving participants. Thank you. Good evening. Thank you. César, I just wanted to consider... César, I'm just considering that this issue of hiring, resigning is an administrative matter, but take a look at this story because I think it's really unnecessary. We'll talk to César. It can be perfect. Okay. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening.\n",
